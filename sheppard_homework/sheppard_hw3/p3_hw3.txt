p3_hw3.py: Use and Information

This program receives a string through user input and processes it in a variety of ways and displays the results to the monitor.
It first prompts the user to enter of a string of three or more words using the input function. It then generates a list containing the words in the string using the split() method that itemizes a string by separating elements by spaces.
To ensure the user enters a string of at least three characters, the program uses a while loop that tests the length of the list and reprompts the user until it is at least three words.
Printing the words in the string can then simply be achieved by iterating over the words in the list.
