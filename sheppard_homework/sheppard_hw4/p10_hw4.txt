P10) Time Server Explanation
# filename: p10_hw4.txt

This program will serve the current time when a connection is establish to TCP port 55555 on the RPi.
The program first defines a function bind_port(prt) taken from the server.py example code that creates a socket and binds to port prt. The program then calls this function on port 55555.
If this function executes without error, then a connection was established, and the program determines the current local time using the time.asctime() method.
Again following the server.py example code, the program outputs this time to a file that can then be read by the program and sent through the socket. The program then continues to follow the example code using the sendall commands to send both a connection message and the time of connection to the client. Running this program along side the example code client.py produces the following output:

Calling p10_hw4.py (server program):
jrsrpi95:/home/pi/sheppard_homework/sheppard_hw4$ ./p10_hw4.py

Calling client.py (client program):
jrsrpi95:/home/pi/phys129/python$ ./client.py 55555

Connecting to 127.0.0.1, port 55555...

Connection closed.

70 bytes received.


Data:

b'\n\nWe Have a connection!\n\nLocal date and time:\nSun Jul 23 06:30:16 2017'


Decoded data:



We Have a connection!

Local date and time:
Sun Jul 23 06:30:16 2017

Thus, this program establishes a connection to TCP port 55555 and serves the current time to the client program.
