P1) Project specification
filename: p1_hw4.txt

a) List of group Members:
Jackson Sheppard

b) Description:
My Physics 129 final project will be a program that solves the two dimensional heat equation for a rectangular plate with user controlled boundary conditions. The program will then display using a 3D plot the temperature of the square plate as a function of position on the plate x and y and will change with time t. The basic algorithm will be to expres the solution as a multidimensional Taylor expansion about x, y, and t. The program will then increment t by set amounts and see how the temperature changes at specified locations x and y according to the differential equation. The result is a numerical solution of the system, which can then be plotted as a three dimensional surface plot and contour plot for a visual representation of the temperature of the plate.

c) List of additional hardware:
none

d) List of pre-written software components in addition to standard Linux/Python installation on RPi
matplotlib
mplot3d
numpy

e) Description of software I will write:
I will write the program that will consider hundreds of points along a two dimensional grid representing the plate and calculate temperature gradients according to the differential equation. I will then use matplotlib to create a visual representation of the solution using 3D surface plots and 2D contour plots showing lines of constant temperature and equations of heat flow.

f) List of Tasks
1) Solve differential equation with taylor expansion technique
2) Write function to consider large 2d array of input data and model according to differential equation
3) Create plotting function to show a 3d visual representation of the solution
4) Allow plot to change with time t according to user controlled boundary conditions.
