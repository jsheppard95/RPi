P3) Threaded Stripchart Explanation
p3_hw6.txt

This program modies the previous stripchart program to display the value of a
global variable. It does sow by spawning a thread that continuously prompts
the user to enter a new value and stores the value in this global variable.
The program continues to run and prompt the user until it is quit usong CTRL-Z.

The only modification that needs to be made to the "__init__" function within
the scope class is within the "set_ylim" function. This change is to set the
limits from (-value-5) to (value+5), where value is the user entered global
vairable. This ensures the value entered by the user is always in view on the
plot. Within the function "emitter", I also changed the yield statement to
be the value stored in the global variable "value"

The function to be passed to the thread is called "get_value" and simply
contains an inifite while loop prompting the user to enter a number. It then
uses a "try, except" conditional to ensure the user enters a valid number
without crashing the program, and stores the entered number in the global
variable "value".

The "__main__" function contains the call to start the thread with the
function "get_value", while the "__main__" function calls the Scope class to
begin showing the global variable initially set as 0.5.

The result is a program that continually displays this global variable as the
user updates it from the terminal.
